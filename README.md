Hi! I'm **Adib Miraki**, a **Bioinformatician** at the Lotfollahi Lab at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. My work focuses on applying **generative machine learning models** to single-cell and spatial multi-modal omics data, bridging cutting-edge computational techniques with complex biological questions.

I’m passionate about **coding**, **biological reasoning**, and building tools that help decode cellular behavior. Beyond the science, I truly enjoy connecting with others, whether through scientific collaboration or community engagement.

When I’m not diving into data, you'll probably find me playing video games, watching or playing football, or enjoying good conversations.

Let’s connect and build something meaningful!
